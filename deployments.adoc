== Deployment Patterns

=== Blue/Green deployment

Blue/Green deployment is a technique where two different environments/versions (Blue and Green) of the same application  are running in parallel but only one of them is receiving requests from the router at a time.

To release a new version, the router is updated to switch between the "Blue" environment and point to the "Green" environment.

This strategy is based on link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/deployment#blue-green-deployment[Openshift deployment examples] and it uses the `API-Gateway` project, but it could be used with any other project:

- Modify the service.
----
$ cd /api-gateway

$ vim src/main/java/com/redhat/developers/msa/api_gateway/ApiGatewayController.java

# replace .map((feign) -> feign.invokeService(serverSpan))
# by      .map((feign) -> "UPDATED - " + feign.invokeService(serverSpan))
----

- Create a `"new"` version of the application using a **different name**..
----
$ oc new-build --binary --name=api-gateway-new -l app=api-gateway-new
$ mvn package && oc start-build api-gateway-new --from-dir=. --follow
$ oc new-app api-gateway-new -l app=api-gateway-new,hystrix.enabled=true
----

- Enable Readiness probe
----
$ oc set probe dc/api-gateway-new --readiness --get-url=http://:8080/health
----

- Switch the route to the `"new"` application.
----
$ oc patch route/api-gateway -p '{"spec": {"to": {"name": "api-gateway-new" }}}'

# To return to the "old" application
$ oc patch route/api-gateway -p '{"spec": {"to": {"name": "api-gateway" }}}'
----

- (Optional) Remove the "old" version.
----
$ oc delete is,bc,dc,svc api-gateway
$ oc delete builds -l build=api-gateway
----

=== Canary deployments

Canary deployments are a way of sending out a new version of your app into production that plays the role of a “canary” to get an idea of how it will perform (integrate with other apps, CPU, memory, disk usage, etc). Canary releases let you test the waters before pulling the trigger on a full release.

This strategy is based on link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/deployment#rolling-deployments-with-canary-checks[Openshift deployment examples] and it uses the `Bonjour` project, but it could be used with any other project:

- Modify the service.
----
$ cd /bonjour

$ vim bonjour.js

# replace  return "Bonjour de " + os.hostname();
# by       return "Version 2 - Bonjour de " + os.hostname();
----

- Create a `"new"` version of the application using a **different name**..
----
$ oc new-build --binary --name=bonjour-new -l app=bonjour-new
$ npm install && oc start-build bonjour-new --from-dir=. --follow
$ oc new-app bonjour-new
----

- Enable Readiness probe
----
$ oc set probe dc/bonjour-new --readiness --get-url=http://:8080/api/health
----

- Apply a common label (svc=canary-bonjour) for both versions (A/B)
----
$ oc patch dc/bonjour -p '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"labels":{"svc":"canary-bonjour"}}}}}'
$ oc patch dc/bonjour-new -p '{"spec":{"template":{"metadata":{"labels":{"svc":"canary-bonjour"}}}}}'
----

- Update the Service and Routes
----
$ oc delete svc bonjour && oc delete route bonjour
$ oc expose dc/bonjour --selector='svc=canary-bonjour' --session-affinity='ClientIP' && oc expose svc/bonjour
----

- Simulate multiple clients
----
$ oc scale dc/bonjour --replicas=3

# Simulate 10 new clients and note that 25% of the requests are made on bonjour-new.
$ for i in {1..10}; do curl http://bonjour-helloworld-msa.rhel-cdk.10.1.2.2.xip.io/api/bonjour ; echo ""; done;

# Simulate the same client
$ curl -b cookies.txt -c cookies.txt  http://bonjour-helloworld-msa.rhel-cdk.10.1.2.2.xip.io/api/bonjour

# To change the credentials, delete the cookies file
$ rm cookies.txt
----

- To return to the original state
----
$ oc delete route bonjour &&  oc delete svc bonjour
$ oc expose dc/bonjour
$ oc scale dc/bonjour --replicas=1
$ oc delete all -l app=bonjour=new
----
