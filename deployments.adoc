== Deployment Patterns

=== Blue/Green deployment

Blue/Green deployment is a technique where two different environments/versions (Blue and Green) of the same application  are running in parallel but only one of them is receiving requests from the router at a time.

To release a new version, the router is updated to switch between the "Blue" environment and point to the "Green" environment.

This strategy is based on link:https://github.com/openshift/origin/tree/master/examples/deployment#blue-green-deployment[Openshift deployment examples] and it uses the `API-Gateway` project, but it could be used with any other project:

- Modify the service.
----
$ cd /api-gateway

$ vim src/main/java/com/redhat/developers/msa/api_gateway/ApiGatewayController.java

# replace .map((feign) -> feign.invokeService(serverSpan))
# by      .map((feign) -> "UPDATED - " + feign.invokeService(serverSpan))
----

- Create a `"new"` version of the application using a **different name**..
----
$ oc new-build --binary --name=api-gateway-new -l app=api-gateway-new
$ mvn package; oc start-build api-gateway-new --from-dir=. --follow
$ oc new-app api-gateway-new -l app=api-gateway-new,hystrix.enabled=true
----

- Enable Readiness probe

----
$ oc patch dc/api-gateway-new -p '{"spec":{"template":{"spec":{"containers":[{"name":"api-gateway-new","readinessProbe":{"httpGet":{"path":"/health","port":8080}}}]}}}}'
----

- Switch the route to the `"new"` application.
----
$ oc patch route/api-gateway -p '{"spec": {"to": {"name": "api-gateway-new" }}}'

# To return to the "old" application
$ oc patch route/api-gateway -p '{"spec": {"to": {"name": "api-gateway" }}}'
----

- (Optional) Remove the "old" version.
----
$ oc delete is,bc,dc,svc api-gateway
$ oc delete builds -l build=api-gateway
----
